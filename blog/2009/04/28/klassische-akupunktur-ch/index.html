<h1>klassische-akupunktur.ch</h1>
<p>Tomorrow, my sister Carol will celebrate the opening of her acupuncture practice. Over the last month, I had the pleasure to help her design and implement a corporate identity, including business cards, flyers, and a website. The <a href="http://klassische-akupunktur.ch">site</a>actually went live just a few moments ago, so while everything is still fresh and warm, I’d like to share some of the experiences i have made in the course of its making:</p>
<p>The most profound decision was probably to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">scalable vector graphics</a> as a result-independent model behind all work. This turned out to be a good decision. In practice, we initially designed everything in <a href="http://www.inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> and later converted to pdf (for print), or to jpg/gif (for the web). Inkscape itself is a simple and stable open source application which is comparable to illustrator, freehand, or coreldraw. The pdf-conversion is built-in and just works (print margins can only be defined via script though). The creation of bitmap images however is very disappointing. No matter how much i fiddled, the font rendering seemed to be broken and the results all looked very crappy (probably due to the missing font hinting, who knows?). Luckily, i remembered the java-based batik toolkit, which includes a stand-alone <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/tools/rasterizer.html">svg rasterizing utility</a>. It is a simple jar file that can be invoked from the command line and which produces great results.</p>
<p>With the pdfs, the printing was basically solved – the visuals turned out exactly as we designed them, so we were able to focus our resources on the website.</p>
<p>My web design “skills” were dating back to the time when tables and invisible spacer.gifs used to be the ultimate tools, so i first had to brush-up my css knowledge (or actually: steal snippets from here and there – and spend the rest of the day on <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/">http://www.quirksmode.org</a>). Now that it’s done, I really like the clean separation between content and style. I used <a href="http://eclipse.org/">eclipse</a> to (hand-)write all html and css code, but even in an editor I know cold, it was a pain to e.g. manually insert the same <a href="http://weblog.helpware.net/?p=119">IE 8 compatibility tag</a> on every single page. Thus, in retrospect, we probably should have used a content management system, even for a very small site.</p>
<p>The main part that’s still not done is the complete search engine optimization work – while it’s probably the most important part, I keep procrastinating. If anyone is an expert, please speak up (and I am confident that we can arrange for some needle pain in return ;-)).</p>
