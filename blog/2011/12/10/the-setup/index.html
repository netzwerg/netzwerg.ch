<h1>The Setup</h1>
<p>I started my new job at <a href="http://edorasware.com">edorasware</a> last week, with a new &amp; shiny 15-inch MacBook Pro. A fresh computer with a blank OS is both, a blessing and a curse – it takes quite a while until it feels like home again. And even after a week, I still miss a few configuration settings or shortcuts here and there.</p>
<p>Setting up the new machine was certainly an opportunity to consolidate the apps and tools I like and need. Inspired by <a href="http://usesthis.com">The Setup</a>, here’s what I currently use to get things done:</p>
<p>As a Java developer, I spend most of my time in <a href="http://www.jetbrains%20.com/idea">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, the best IDE ever (weight this statement by the fact that I used Eclipse for 7+ years before). My second home is the command line. I use <a href="http://www.iterm2.com">iTerm2</a>, which has excellent search support, provides mouseless copying, and is more unixy than the official <em>Terminal</em>. I’m still learning to use <em> Finder</em> efficiently. The <a href="http://totalfinder.binaryage.com">TotalFinder</a> plug-in, with tab support and its <em>Folders on Top</em> mode, is my latest attempt at making friends.</p>
<p>A few crucial things help me organize &amp; navigate my workspace: I use three virtual desktops (via <em>Mission Control</em>) which I access by keyboard shortcuts – 1 for Mail/Calendar, 2 for Browser, and 3 for IDEA. A launcher helps me kick-start applications. I switched from Quicksilver to <a href="http://alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> – it provides the same features and is under active development. <a href="http://mizage.%20com">Divvy</a> tames all window sizes &amp; positions, clearly a missing feature in OSX.</p>
<p>Transitioning from <em>Snow Leopard</em> to <em>Lion</em> was more challenging than anticipated, mainly because of its different mouse usage paradigms. Most of the built-in gestures are easy to use, but some of them collide with my old habits (how the heck can I turn off horizontal scrolling in order to re-map the swipe gesture to back/forward navigation in IDEA?!). A while back I forced myself to exclusively use taps (rather than clicks) on the trackpad. Wow – the absence of the mechanical noise makes such a difference, everything suddenly feels very light and smooth!</p>
<p>These are pretty much the apps at the core. In addition, I like <a href="http://www.%20google.ch/chrome">Chrome</a>, <a href="http://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a>, <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a>, <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, <a href="http://skype.com">Skype</a>, <a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a>, <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/acorn">Acorn</a>, <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom">Lightroom</a> and <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle">OmniGraffle</a> – just to name a few.</p>
<p>What are your favorite tools we should all know about?</p>
