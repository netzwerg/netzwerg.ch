<h1>Bloxorz</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, the <a href="http://class.coursera.org/progfun-2012-001">Scala course at Coursera</a> is over. It was really an excellent experience and I am desperately waiting for part two. The lectures were a bit on the slow side (luckily the player featured nice high-speed playback), but the assignments were rather challenging. As far as I know, the course material will stay available indefinitely, so if you missed the course, you can still sign up and watch the videos or download the exercises just for fun.</p>
<p>Due to the official code of honour, I am not allowed to discuss any actual code here, but the last assignment is still worth mentioning: Based on the concept of lazy data structures, we were asked to find a generic solution to the <a href="http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-bloxorz/">Bloxorz game</a>. When I initially read the assignment, I doubted that this would be possible within a reasonable amount of time. But the exercises were so well crafted, that they guided us in a step-by-step fashion – in the end, I managed to get the maximal score within less than two hours.</p>
<p>Inspired by the addictive block-rolling, I was recently playing around with CSS3. I really have no 3D experience whatsoever, but here’s my quick shot at some basic transformations (webkit only; put focus on cube and press left/right arrows):</p>
