                    I am interested in languages, frameworks & tools that encourage the development of scalable
                    software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Scalability</b> is the cornerstone of all application development aspects. It shapes how
                    users <b>interact</b> with a computer:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The choice of programming language determines how developers can express their intents.</li>
                    <li>Build & test automation tames complexity.</li>
                    <li>Efficient data structures and performant algorithms are crucial for meeting big data demands.
                        They are the foundation for interactive user interfaces.
                    </li>
                    <li>Reactive architectures encourage systems that are robust, resilient, and flexible enough to meet
                        modern requirements.
                    </li>
                    <li>Responsive user interfaces guarantee scalability across the range of end-user devices.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>My Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    Trends come and go, new technologies emerge, paradigms shift &mdash; whatever happens, the core values of
                    software development stay the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My vision is to lead a group of developers who build scalable software solutions in close
                    collaboration with industry partners. Thanks to a diverse range of former employers, I am in
                    frequent contact with leading experts at companies like <a
                        href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>, <a href="http://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>, or
                    <a href="http://www.canoo.com/">Canoo</a> &mdash; experts who are always open for joint projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to be a mentor and a role model for aspiring software developers. Crafting software entails
                    much more than programming &mdash; design & architecture, testing, release management, and product
                    maintenance are all essential aspects. My teaching is fueled by many years of development experience
                    in international teams. Most importantly, I want to share my passion and keep learning by teaching
                    others.

                    The Molecular Microbial Ecology research group at ETH/Eawag
                    focuses on the ecology and evolution of bacteria.
                    The group uses a semi-automated program pipeline to analyze vast amounts of microscope images.
                    Certain steps in this program pipeline are not optimized for efficient manual analysis, and are
                    thereby limiting hypothesis generation.

                <p>
                    A new GUI with a more efficient interaction concept and tailor-made
                    visualizations will mitigate this bottleneck.

                    When teaching computer programming, live coding demonstrations are very valuable for students.
                    After a lecture, students might want to reproduce a live coding session at home, at their own pace.
                    However, traditional video recordings are not powerful enough to capture the complete programming
                    process. Specifically, students should also be able to actually work with the code as it evolved
                    during the
                    demonstration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A new tool will allow to capture and reproduce live coding sessions on the
                    level of source code changes.
