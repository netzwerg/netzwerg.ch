                    I have an intrinsic motivation to share my learning process and findings with others, thereby
                    building a ramp for everyone who comes behind me. <a href="http://netzwerg.ch/">My blog</a>

                    <b>Introduction To Programming</b></a> &mdash; <em>Institute of Computer Science, University of
                Basel</em>
                <p>
                    During my studies, I was a teaching assistant at the Institute of Computer Science, where I tutored
                    introductory-level programming in Java, HTML & Javascript.
                </p>
                <a href="http://www.fhnw.ch/lifesciences/modul/9048351"><b>Programming II</b></a> &mdash; <em>Life
                Science Technologies, FHNW</em>
                <p>I currently teach this module in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Dominique Brodbeck. The course
                    covers advanced programming principles using the Java language.</p>
                <p>For this semester, I completely
                    restructured the course material and made it available
                    <a href="http://fhnw-biomedinf.github.io/prog-II/">publicly</a>. The material is optimized for a
                    flipped classroom setting: The material is optimized for a flipped classroom setting: Students get a
                    summary of the most important course topics which they research on their own.
                    Well-crafted exercises based on test-driven development help track progress and are highly
                    motivating. Finally, a real-world project rounds off the course.
                </p>
                <p>In-class lectures are spent on live programming, discussions, and personal code reviews.</p>
                <a href="https://git-scm.com/"><b>Git Workshops</b></a> &mdash; <em>Basler Versicherungenen</em>
                <p>Git is a free and open source version control system which is known to have a steep learning
                    curve. During my work at Basler Versicherungen, I was responsible for migrating all software
                    development projects from CVS to Git. Initially, I only had a technical role in this migration.
                    Thanks to my flair for explaining difficult things in simple words, I ended up teaching Git
                    workshops
                    across the complete software department. I enjoyed these workshops a lot, there's nothing as
                    rewarding as hearing a <em>"Thank you, finally I get it!"</em> from a participant who previously
                    felt lost
                    and confused.
